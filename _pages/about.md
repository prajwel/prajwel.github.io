I am a project scientist at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstroSat">AstroSat</a> UltraViolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) Payload Operations Centre, Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore. UVIT is a space telescope on board the AstroSat space observatory. My job involves:
* Routine UVIT health monitoring and science data processing.
* Software development for monitoring, handling, processing and analysing UVIT health and science data. 
* Detecting and solving UVIT instrument problems as they arise. 

I am interested in open-source software and projects. Please visit my <a href="https://github.com/prajwel">Github profile</a> to see my interests and activity. Also, please see:

My scientific interests are varied; however, I am particularly interested in studying the impact of AGN activity on star formation in galaxies. You can find my articles on the <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=zSnUDggAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar profile</a>. Here's a Twitter thread on a recent publication (I really like the 3D interactive we made for it!).
