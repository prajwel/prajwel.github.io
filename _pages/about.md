<!-- I am currently working at the AstroSat UVIT Payload Operations Centre, Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore.   -->
I primarily work as part of the AstroSat UVIT team at UVIT Payload Operations Centre, Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore. I am involved with the routine processing of UVIT data, monitoring the instrument performance, and developing software in Python. I am also working on my PhD thesis that I hope to complete soon (how soon? good question). My interests can be best explained as a monkey who tries to get his hands in whatever appeals.
