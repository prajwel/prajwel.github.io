<!-- I am currently working at the AstroSat UVIT Payload Operations Centre, Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore.   -->
I primarily work as part of the AstroSat UVIT team at UVIT Payload Operations Centre, Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore. I am involved with the routine UVIT data processing, instrument monitoring, and Python software development. I am also working on my PhD thesis on star formation that I hope to complete soon (how soon? good question). My interests are varied and best explained by a monkey who tries to get his hands in whatever appeals.
