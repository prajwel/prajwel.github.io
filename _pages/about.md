**I am a project scientist** at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstroSat">AstroSat</a> UltraViolet Imaging Telescope (<a href="https://www.iiap.res.in/projects/uvit/">UVIT</a>) Payload Operations Centre (POC), Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore. UVIT is a space telescope onboard the AstroSat space observatory. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/iiabengaluru/albums/72177720319674566/">Click here to explore the stunning cosmic images captured by UVIT</a>. UVIT is India's first and <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/-6O7VXcNTuSE-DIy8hWl6Q">most successful space telescope</a> with high-resolution imaging capability.

I have been part of the <a href="https://www.iiap.res.in/projects/uvit/poc/">UVIT POC</a> since 2016. My job at the UVIT POC involves:
* Routine monitoring of UVIT's health and processing of its scientific data.
* Developing software for monitoring, handling, processing, and analysing UVIT's health and scientific data.
* Detecting and solving any issues with the UVIT instrument as they arise. 

Currently, my primary focus is on creating a **new UVIT data release**. To achieve this, a new UVIT data pipeline, <a href="https://github.com/prajwel/UVPipe">UVPipe</a>, has been developed. The latest UVIT observations are being processed using this new pipeline, and eventually, all UVIT data will be reprocessed through <a href="https://github.com/prajwel/UVPipe">UVPipe</a>.

I am **passionate about open-source** software and projects. You can check out my work on my <a href="https://github.com/prajwel">Github profile</a>. Here are a few projects Iâ€™m involved in:
* <a href="https://curvit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Curvit</a>: For creating light curves using UVIT data.
* <a href="https://github.com/prajwel/aafitrans">Aafitrans</a>: For matching coordinate lists.
* <a href="https://github.com/prajwel/canuvit">CanUVIT</a>: For conducting UVIT safety checks.
* <a href="https://github.com/prajwel/UVIT_notebooks">UVIT notebooks</a>


I am actively involved in astronomy research, particularly investigating how **AGN activity impacts star formation in galaxies**. You can explore my publications on my <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=zSnUDggAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar profile</a>.
