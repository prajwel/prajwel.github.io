<!-- I am currently working at the AstroSat UVIT Payload Operations Centre, Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore.   -->
I used to work as part of the AstroSat UVIT team at UVIT Payload Operations Centre, Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore. I was involved with the routine UVIT data processing, instrument monitoring, and Python software development. Presently, I am working on my PhD thesis on star formation that I hope to complete soon (how soon? good question).
