I am a project scientist at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstroSat">AstroSat</a> UltraViolet Imaging Telescope (<a href="https://www.iiap.res.in/projects/uvit/">UVIT</a>) Payload Operations Centre (POC), Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore. UVIT is a space telescope onboard the AstroSat space observatory. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/iiabengaluru/albums/72177720319674566/">Click here to explore the stunning cosmic images captured by UVIT</a>.

I have been part of the UVIT POC since 2016. My job at the UVIT POC involves:
* Routine monitoring of UVIT's health and processing of its scientific data.
* Developing software for monitoring, handling, processing, and analysing UVIT's health and scientific data.
* Detecting and solving any issues with the UVIT instrument as they arise. 

Currently, my primary focus is on creating a new UVIT data release. To achieve this, a new UVIT data pipeline, <a href="https://github.com/prajwel/UVPipe">UVPipe</a>, has been developed. The latest UVIT observations are being processed using this new pipeline, and eventually, all UVIT data will be reprocessed through <a href="https://github.com/prajwel/UVPipe">UVPipe</a>.

I am passionate about open-source software and projects. You can check out my activity on my <a href="https://github.com/prajwel">Github profile</a>. Here are a few projects Iâ€™m involved in:
* <a href="https://curvit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Curvit</a> (to create light curves using UVIT data)
* <a href="https://github.com/prajwel/aafitrans">Aafitrans</a> (to match coordinate lists)
* <a href="https://github.com/prajwel/canuvit">Canuvit</a> (to carry out UVIT safety checks)
* <a href="https://github.com/prajwel/UVIT_notebooks">UVIT notebooks</a>


I am also conducting research in astronomy, with a particular focus on the effects of AGN activity on star formation in galaxies. You can find my articles on the <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=zSnUDggAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar profile</a>, and here is a Twitter thread about a recent publication.
